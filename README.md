# JConcat
This is the official github repo for the JConcat-Application.

## What is JConcat?
JConcat is a user interface for the FFmpeg (s. https://www.ffmpeg.org/) concat protocol.

## What is JConcat useful for?
JConcat can be used to concatenate (join end to end) video files of the same format. This is a feature of FFmpeg and you can do this even without this program. But you will have to use a command line and write one or more files. Because that is annoying and some people don't know command lines, this program can be used to simplify and automate much of the manual configuration.

## What is FFmpeg?
FFmpeg is a free, open-source media editing software. It can be used on multiple plattforms including Mac, Windows and Linux, is really fast and can to some degree even be used in commercial applications. You will need to download FFmpeg from their website https://www.ffmpeg.org/ to use JConcat.

## What is so special about the FFmpeg concat protocol?
You may be asking yourself, why you should use FFmpeg and JConcat to concatenate your video files, when you have a nice commercial video editing software, that can do the same thing. Time is the reason. With the FFmpeg concat protocol you can concatenate several hours worth of high definition video material in minutes. That is a lot faster, than most other programs can do.
